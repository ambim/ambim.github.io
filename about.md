Hello! This is Will's blog where I like to write about the things that interest me around the intersection of data, technology and the AEC industries (Architecture, Engineering & Construction). 

Here's a few more things about me:

 * I'm a data scientist with an entrepreneurial side. Most of my experience has been on smart infrastructure/ smart buildings/ IoT deployments and the analysis thereof. 
 * I'm currently researching and writing my MSc thesis on the topic of neural approaches to Natural Language Processing. 
 * I'm a serial hackathon-er, especially ones related to AEC problems. Here's one I won before with a [great team](http://aec-labs.com/2016/11/uber-for-concrete-wins-uks-construction-news-first-hackathon/).   
 * Outside of the data-sphere, I love to run long distances!
